# While the Elves get to work printing the correctly-ordered updates, you have a little time to fix the rest of them.
#
# For each of the incorrectly-ordered updates, use the page ordering rules to put the page numbers in the right order.
# For the above example, here are the three incorrectly-ordered updates and their correct orderings:
#
#     75,97,47,61,53 becomes 97,75,47,61,53.
#     61,13,29 becomes 61,29,13.
#     97,13,75,29,47 becomes 97,75,47,29,13.
#
# After taking only the incorrectly-ordered updates and ordering them correctly, their middle page numbers are 47, 29,
# and 47. Adding these together produces 123.
#
# Find the updates which are not in the correct order. What do you get if you add up the middle page numbers after
# correctly ordering just those updates?

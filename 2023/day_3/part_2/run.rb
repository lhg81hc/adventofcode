# The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one.
# If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.
#
# The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers
# and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a
# "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)
#
# Here is an example engine schematic:
#
# 467..114..
# ...*......
# ..35..633.
# ......#...
# 617*......
# .....+.58.
# ..592.....
# ......755.
# ...$.*....
# .664.598..
#
# In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58
# (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.
#
# Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger.
#
# What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?
